// This is an implementation of TicTacToe for Windows Console. This was written by Max Elliott as part of a programming test/assignment for 
// Psyonix in February of 2021

#include <iostream>


// We will need a few things as part of the core architecture/functionality
// 1) A data structure to represent the state of the board
// 2) A method for checking the state of the board for win/lose/draw
// 3) A way to display the current state of the board
// 4) Some command/input parsing
// 5) A help system
// 6) Some documentation

// BONUS POINTS:
// 1) An undo system that lets the user rewind/forward the game arbitrarily
// 2) Support a generalized m,n,k variation of the game 

// The code should essentially be self documenting, but if I have time, I will add some simple HTML docs
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Welcome to the TicTacToe Game!\n";
